# ðŸ‘‹ Hello there, my name is GermÃ¡n LÃ³pez
### I am a Technical Designer & Game Programmer specialized in Unreal Engine & Unity.

I am a Game Designer currently living in Spain.

I studied Game Design and Development at Rey Juan Carlos University, on Madrid. During this degree I worked on numerous projects which I highlight Into the Cave, Revenge .44, Shinobi no NoboruÂ and my TFG project: Stigma Protocol.

In addition, in the degree I have had to make use of different programming languages such as C++, C#, Javascript, Java and C, along with game engines like Unity, Unreal Engine 4 or Gamemaker Studio.

I am currently studying Game Design Master's Degree at U-tad, on Las Rozas.Â 

I joined multiple game jams such as Texel Jam 2018, where my team was winner of the public vote, and URJam 2020, where my team was also the winner, but this time by the jury.

Now, in 2022, I am looking for finishing my university studies and adquire new knowledge in order to jump into the world of work.
